// Mobile browsers freeze the page during a back transition and may
// restore it from the bfcache. rAF is paused throughout, and every
// render() is scheduled through rAF — so a view change made just before
// the freeze has its repaint stranded until the page fully resumes,
// which showed up as the session list taking seconds to appear
// highlighted after Back on a phone (and never on desktop, which does
// not freeze the page for same-document navigation). Nothing in the
// render gates can rescue that; the paint has to be re-requested once
// frames are running again.
// Producing the right DOM isn't enough coming back from a back
// navigation on iOS: an inspector timeline showed the session list's
// first frame already correct while the phone screen stayed frozen and
// unscrollable for seconds. That combination — correct DOM, dead screen,
// no long JS task — is the compositor still presenting the navigation
// snapshot iOS captured for the transition, rather than the live page.
//
// Nothing in JS can force a present directly, but changing a property
// that invalidates compositing gets the layer rebuilt, which in practice
