// Local persistence for the session list, so a cold page load (app
// relaunch, hard refresh, iOS killing a backgrounded PWA) can paint the
// rail immediately instead of showing an empty list while the daemon
// answers the first /api/sessions request.
//
// THAT IS ALL IT DOES. It is a picture, not a source of truth — see
// history-cache.ts's doc comment for the incident history behind that
// rule on the sibling chat cache; the same discipline applies here.
// api.ts's pollAllSessions always treats the daemon's response as
// authoritative and merges onto whatever this seeded, never the other
// way around. Being stale, holed or entirely absent costs nothing but a
// slower first paint.
//
// It DOES also seed the `since=` cursor used to ask the daemon for an
// incremental listing (see PROTOCOL.md's GET /v1/sessions `since=`, and
// session-merge.ts). That is safe in a way the chat cache's old cursor
// usage was not: an incorrect/stale cursor here can only make the next
// response BIGGER (more rows come back as "changed since"), never drop
// data, because the daemon's tombstones never expire (session-manager.ts)
// and mtime-based filtering is monotonic. Worst case is a wasted byte or
// two, not a silently missing session.
//
// IndexedDB, not localStorage — at a few thousand sessions this can run
// into the hundreds of KB (see trimForCache for what's actually kept),
// past the threshold history-cache.ts's own comment gives for avoiding
// localStorage's shared, smaller per-origin quota.
//
// Warm sessions are downgraded to "cold" before being persisted (see
// trimForCache) rather than dropped outright. They used to be dropped —
// the daemon returns the full warm set on every poll anyway, so caching
// them felt like dead weight — but that meant a session busy/warm at
// last write simply had no row at all in a cold-launch's first paint, a
// hole that filled in only once the first live poll landed. A stale
// "cold" is a small, self-correcting lie; a missing session card looks
// broken. status/busy are the only fields that lie this way — busy in
// particular only means anything mid-turn, which a cache can never
// still be by the time it's read back.
