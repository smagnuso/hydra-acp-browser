// Swipe navigation between the session list and a chat:
//   - List → chat: swipe right-to-left anywhere on the list to jump
//     back into the session you last closed (state.lastSessionId,
//     stashed by closeChat() in routing.ts).
//   - Chat → list: swipe left-to-right anywhere in the chat to close
//     it. Rather than gating by a fixed start zone (too narrow to hit
//     reliably; too wide and it starts eating the composer/header),
//     hasScrollableLeftAncestor bails only when the touch actually
//     landed on something that could itself consume a rightward drag —
//     a horizontally-scrolled code block or table (index.html's
//     `pre`/`.msg .body table` overflow-x: auto) with room left to
//     scroll — and isFormControl bails on text inputs so a text-
//     selection drag in the composer isn't hijacked. Everything else
//     in the chat (bubbles, header, armed-tasks block, …) arms it.
//
// The chat is always the topmost, frontmost layer — whether it's
// departing (a back swipe) or arriving (a forward swipe) — mirroring
// how a native push/pop transition always keeps the pushed view
// frontmost regardless of direction; the list, as the "root" underneath
// it, always gets a parallax recede + darkening scrim instead. Whichever
// side is real, live DOM (#app's direct children — one for chat, three
// for list: topbar/search/list) is dragged directly via an inline
// transform; the OTHER side is a static preview inserted for the
// gesture. Committing past THRESHOLD_PX finishes that motion, then
// hands off to the real navigation. Swiping back into the
// exact session you just left is special-cased end to end: the reveal
// pane reuses that session's real, still-intact chat DOM (still cached
// by identity in views.ts's chatViews WeakMap even though closeChat()
// detached it), and committing resumes that SAME ChatState in place
// (routing.ts's reopenClosedChat) rather than opening a fresh one from
// scratch — which would reset the log to empty and the scroll to top
// right as the preview showing the real, already-scrolled transcript
// hands off, reading as a flicker. Every other case (a different
// session, or list -> list — i.e. closeChat()) still tears down and
// rebuilds #app from scratch as normal. Cancelling animates everything
// back and cleans up by hand either way.
//
// Only wired up in narrow layout: in split view both panes are already
// on screen side by side, so there's nothing to reveal.
//
// Mirrors pull-refresh.ts's touch-gesture shape otherwise: module-level
// touch state, document-level listeners, a direction lock so a normal
// vertical scroll is never disturbed. touchmove only calls
// preventDefault() once locked into a confirmed horizontal swipe (same
// override pull-refresh.ts uses for its own gesture) — before that,
// while a touch is still an undecided candidate, it's left completely
// alone. Without it, the touch's target (still whatever was under the
// finger at touchstart — the departing chat's own scrollable body, on a
// back swipe) can keep honoring the browser's native vertical scroll
// for the rest of THIS SAME touch even after the horizontal drag has
// locked in, since a passive listener never gets the chance to say
// otherwise — the two visibly fighting over the one finger.
