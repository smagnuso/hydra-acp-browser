  lastSeenSeq?: number;

  // path the partial bubble is NOT re-sent, so purging would delete it.

  // replay cap (PROTOCOL.md's historyLimit). Set by requestFullHistory,
  // consumed by connectChatSocket. Without it "Load full history" still
  // came back capped, so on a session longer than the cap the button
  // could not do what it says.

  // One-shot: the next reconcile is a full-replay swap, so pin to the
  // bottom unconditionally rather than through pinIfDue's settle
  // heuristics. Those guards exist to keep a pin from colliding with a
  // live iOS rubber-band; a swap is app-driven with no gesture in play,
  // and the scroll events it generates defeat the guards anyway. See
  // pinAfterSwap in views.ts.
  pinAfterReplaySwap?: boolean;
  // True when log[] holds less than the session's whole history, so there
  // may be older history on the daemon we don't have. Two sources: a log
  // seeded from the local history-cache.ts cache (itself capped by
  // MAX_BYTES_PER_SESSION), and any cold attach, whose replay is capped by
  // ws-bridge.ts's COLD_ATTACH_HISTORY_LIMIT. Drives the "load full
  // history" button views.ts shows once the user has scrolled to the top
  // of what's locally available. Cleared by routing.ts's
  // requestFullHistory once a genuine full replay lands.
  historyIsPartial?: boolean;
  // messageId of the bubble that was topmost-visible right before
  // requestFullHistory wiped and reloaded the log — a full replay
  // rebuilds brand-new LogItem objects and typically has MORE history
  // above what was previously loaded, so the old raw scrollTop lands on
  // a different message entirely. bridge.ts's bridge/ready consumes
  // this once the replay lands (scroll to the matching
  // data-message-id, then clear it) and gives up silently if the
  // message isn't found — no anchor is exactly today's behavior, not a
  // regression.
