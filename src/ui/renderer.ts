// while a pointer is physically down we hold off on the actual rebuild;
// the deferred render flushes on release.
//
// Originally scoped to button presses only, but the same teardown hits

// is what made scrolling go dead for a few seconds during bursty agent
// output — not just on session attach. Gating on ANY pointerdown (not
// only ones that hit a <button>) covers that: a touch-driven scroll

// historical frame has arrived, so the user watched their transcript
// blank out and scroll back in. Nothing about that repaint is
// informative: the content is about to be the same. Hold the last good
// paint on screen and swap once, when the replay is complete.
//
// Self-releasing, because the thing that ends it is a frame from the
// daemon (bridge/ready) and that frame can simply never arrive — a
// failed attach, a socket that dies mid-replay. A stuck hold would
// freeze the UI on a stale transcript, which is worse than the flicker
// it exists to prevent. Deliberately separate from externalRenderHold
// rather than sharing it: swipe-nav owns that one for the length of a
